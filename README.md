# ❤️ Heart Attack Prediction using Decision Trees (C5.0 & CART)

Hi there 👋, I’m **Swapnil Sudhakar Patil**.  
After working for several years as an engineer, I transitioned into the world of **Data Analytics & Machine Learning**. This project is part of my journey to apply data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems.  

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of mortality, and I wanted to explore how **machine learning models** can help predict the **risk of heart attacks** using patient health data.  
This notebook demonstrates the use of **Decision Tree models (C5.0 and CART)** for classification and comparison.

## 📊 Project Overview
- **Objective**: Predict whether a patient is at risk of a heart attack  
- **Dataset**: Patient health records (attributes like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.)  
- **Algorithms Used**:  
  - 🌳 Decision Tree (CART)  
  - 🌿 Decision Tree (C5.0)  
- **Focus**: Model comparison, interpretability, and identifying key health risk factors  

---

## 🚀 What I Did
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset  
- Performed exploratory data analysis to spot patterns and correlations  
- Trained and evaluated **Decision Tree models**  
- Compared **C5.0 vs CART** in terms of accuracy and interpretability  
- Visualized the trees and extracted key feature insights  

---

## 📈 Key Results
- Decision Trees provided clear **if-else rules** for classifying patients  
- Identified critical factors influencing heart attack predictions  
- Achieved promising accuracy for both CART and C5.0 models

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Scikit-learn** for model building  
- **Pandas / NumPy** for data handling  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualization

## 💡 Why This Project?
As someone moving from **Electronics Engineering → Data Analytics**, I believe projects like this help bridge the gap between technical skills and impactful real-world applications.  
This project gave me hands-on experience in:
- Applying **machine learning models** to health data  
- Comparing algorithms in practice  
- Communicating results through visuals and insights
